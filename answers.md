- **2)**
W(n) = W(n-1) + W(n-2) + 1
W(n) = 2^n



- **3)**
S(n) = S(n-1) + 1
S(n) = O(n)

- **4)**
The last set of calls for counts, the counts list resembles a reverse fibonnacci sequence that counts down.

- **6)**
The function is called at most once for any value and the combination step is in constant time, so W(n) = O(n), S(n) = O(n)

- **8)**
The function will be called at most twice for any value.
W(n) = O(n), S(n) = O(n)
